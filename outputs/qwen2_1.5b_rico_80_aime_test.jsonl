The volume is given by $V = abc$. \n\nWe are given that the volume is $23$, so we have $23 = abc$. \n\nNext, let's consider the surface area of a rectangular box with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$. The surface area is given by $A = 2(ab + bc + ca)$. \n\nWe are given that the surface area is $54$, so we have $54 = 2(ab + bc + ca)$. \n\nNow, let's consider the sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes. The sphere's radius $r$ is related to the box's dimensions by the formula $r = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{4\\pi}}$. \n\nSubstituting the expressions for $A$ and $\\pi$ from the surface area equation, we get $r = \\sqrt{\\frac{23}{4\\pi}}$. \n\nFinally, we need to find $r^2$. \n\nSubstituting the expression for $r$ from the sphere's radius formula, we get $r^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{23}{4\\pi}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{23}{4\\pi}$. \n\nSo, $p = 23$ and $q = 4\\pi$. \n\nTherefore, $p + q = 23 + 4\\pi$. \n\nSince $\\pi$ is approximately $3.14159$, we can approximate $p + q$ as $23 + 4(3.14159) = 23 + 12.56636 = 35.56636$. \n\nHowever, this is not a valid answer because the problem asks for the value of $p + q$ as a fraction. \n\nTo find the correct value of $p + q$, we need to simplify the expression $\\frac{p}{q}$. \n\nWe can rewrite $p + q$ as $\\frac{p}{q} + 1$. \n\nSince $p = 23$ and $q = 4\\pi"}
