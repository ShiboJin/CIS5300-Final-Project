How many cubic yards are in the volume of this box?\n\nAssistant: The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula $V = lwh$, where $l$, $w$, and $h$ are the length, width, and height of the box, respectively.\nSince we want to find the volume in cubic yards, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic yards.\nThere are 3 feet in a yard, so there are $3^3 = 27$ cubic feet in a cubic yard.\nTherefore, the volume of the box in cubic yards is $\\frac{108}{27} = \\boxed{4}$.\n#### 4", "content": "#### 7"}
