Count the number of intervals where $P(x)$ is positive.\n\nStep 1: Find the roots of the polynomial $P(x)$.\nThe roots of the polynomial $P(x)$ are the values of $x$ for which $P(x) = 0$. We can find these roots by setting $P(x)$ equal to zero and solving for $x$.\n\nThe polynomial $P(x)$ can be factored as follows:\n\\[P(x) = (x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10} = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10}.\\]\n\nSetting $P(x)$ equal to zero, we get:\n\\[(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10} = 0.\\]\n\nThis equation has $11$ roots, which are the values of $x$ for which $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10} = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the intervals on the number line where $P(x)$ is positive.\nThe intervals on the number line where $P(x)$ is positive are the intervals where $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10} > 0$.\n\nWe can see that the product $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10}$ is positive for all $x$ in the intervals $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,5)$, $(5,6)$, $(6,7)$, $(7,8)$, $(8,9)$, $(9,10)$, and $(10,11)$.\n\nTherefore, the intervals on the number line where $P(x)$ is positive are the intervals $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$,"}

So, we have 2 possible ways to cover the top right corner.\n\nWe can continue this process for the bottom left and bottom right corners. For each corner, we have 2 possible ways to cover it with the rectangle. So, for each corner, we have a total of 2^3 = 8 possible ways to cover it with the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns needed to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is 8.\n#### 8\nThe answer is: 8 \n If $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$? The equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these two solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? We have $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a+b+c)^2 = 39 + 2(21) = 81$.\nTaking the square", "content": "#### 8"}
