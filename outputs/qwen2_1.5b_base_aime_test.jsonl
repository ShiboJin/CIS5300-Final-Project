We have $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a+b+c)^2 = 39 + 2(21) = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have $a+b+c = \\sqrt{81} = \\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?
